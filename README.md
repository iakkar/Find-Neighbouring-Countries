# Find-Neighbouring-Countries

# Overview
In the Flags Game the user has to find every neighbour of the displayed country. At the start of each round the
data is fetched by the restcountries.com Rest API Server and a random country gets chosen. Each neighbour gets mixed and displayed 
with random others (each one is represented by the corresponding emoji). The user has to find all the correct answers, collecting as many 
points as possible. Feedback is displayed based on the user's progress, while any high score is kept in Local Storage.

# Main Features
- Fetch from Rest API Server
